# LoRa-Latch
An automatic apartment door latch using Arduino and LoRa

### Context
My building has an ancient intercom system that allows visitors to buzz my apt
and a button that allows me to unlock the main door. This project allows me to
unlock the main door by buzzing my apt but only for a set period of time after
receiving a signal via a LoRa module.

### LoRa Modules
